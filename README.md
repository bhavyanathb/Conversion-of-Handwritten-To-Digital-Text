# Conversion-of-Handwritten-Text-To-Digital-Text

Developed a stand alone device which takes an image containing handwritten text as an input and prints the digital text as the output, using OpenCV and Convolutional Neural Network.

# Description

The main aim of the project is Hand written Text Recognition (HTR). HTR
is the task of transcribing images of handwritten text into the digital text.In HTR, the text is written, captured by a mobile phone camera and then the resulting images are processed as input to return its text format. We need openCV and CNN for achieving this task. Our goal is to design a model that tran scribes the images to text with great accuracy.
